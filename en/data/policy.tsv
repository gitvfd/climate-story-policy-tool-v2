Agriculture	1	1-1	01	Improve productivity sustainably through innovation, to lower emissions and feed a growing population	<p>Improving productivity can help reduce emissions by allowing agriculture to produce similar or higher amounts of food with fewer inputs. These productivity improvements will be sustainable if they are backed by regulations and efforts to prevent forest clearing. Boosting productivity requires both adopting existing technologies and techniques more widely, and encouraging innovation. </p> <p>One example is precision agriculture, where digital technologies such as global positioning systems and sensors are helping lower the amount of fertilisers contributing to emissions. For cattle, a leading source of agricultural emissions, improving feed quality and better matching it to the nutritional needs of cattle can help reduce emissions related to milk and meat production. Other innovations in breeding and animal health can also help cut emissions from cattle, while no-till farming can help reduce emissions from crop production.   </p> <p>More government effort is needed to improve agricultural innovation, both nationally and internationally, and to invest in research and development (R&D). Governments should improve public agricultural R&D funding, create the conditions to attract private investment and facilitate public-private partnerships, with the involvement of farmers and other stakeholders. They should also foster international R&D co-operation. </p>	VIDEO:	Planting Better Forests for a Changing Future, OECD (2017)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqGXYz5Sln4	ARTICLE: 	Rice and Risks in the Mekong River Delta, OECD Observer (2018)	https://oecdinsights.org/2018/01/16/rice-and-risks-in-the-mekong-river-delta/	REPORT:	Innovation, Productivity and Sustainability in Food and Agriculture: Main Findings from Country Reviews and Policy Lessons, OECD (2019)	https://dx.doi.org/10.1787/c9c4ec1d-en
Agriculture	2	1-2	02	Reform price-distorting regulations that increase agricultural emissions	<p>Agriculture is a heavily protected sector, with support of USD 530 billion provided directly to producers per year in 2016-18. More than half of this support results from regulatory measures that keep domestic prices above international levels. These can take, for example, the form of quantitative import restrictions, tariff rate quotas and tariffs, to keep cheaper foreign products out of the market, or production quotas that limit domestic production. </p> <p>These policies, along with payments linked to production and to unlimited use of inputs such as fertilisers or fuel, should be overhauled as they help drive up emissions from farming, by encouraging overproduction and more intense agriculture. They also lock producers into certain products, stifling innovation and adaptation to climate change. </p>	ARTICLE:	Managing Earth: The Land-Water-Energy Nexus, OECD Observer (2017)	https://www.oecdobserver.org/news/fullstory.php/aid/5955/Managing_earth:_The_land-water-energy_nexus.html	REPORT:	Agricultural Policy Monitoring and Evaluation, OECD (2019)	https://dx.doi.org/10.1787/39bfe6f3-en	REPORT:	Evaluating the Environmental Impact of Agricultural Policies, OECD (2019)	https://dx.doi.org/10.1787/add0f27c-en
Agriculture	3	1-3	03	Use taxes and support payments to reduce emissions and manage impacts on farmers and consumers 	<p>Mitigating greenhouse gas emissions in agriculture cost-effectively will involve using both carrots and sticks, to encourage better practices among producers to reduce emissions. This means, for example, pricing emissions, using emissions trading, and paying farmers for practices that lower emissions and help put carbon back into the soil through so-called carbon sinks. </p> <p>These measures all involve different trade-offs and the right mix of measures will vary by country. For example, policies requiring farmers to pay for emissions are the most effective and efficient way forward in agriculture in some countries and can help generate government revenue, but they can also impose relatively high costs on farmers - not all of whom can bear them - and can lead to higher food prices. On the other hand, paying farmers to reduce their emissions can ease the impact on producers and consumers, but will also put pressure on public finances unless balanced by a reduction in existing agricultural support. </p>	REPORT:	Enhancing Climate Change Mitigation through Agriculture, OECD (2019)	https://dx.doi.org/10.1787/88b5c98c-en	REPORT:	Cost-Effectiveness of Greenhouse Gas Mitigation Measures for Agriculture: A Literature Review, OECD (2015)	https://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jrvvkq900vj-en			
Agriculture	4	1-4	04	Include agriculture in national climate mitigation strategies 	<p>As other sectors begin to decarbonise, notably energy and transport, agriculture is set to become a leading emitting sector. Policy makers should step up efforts to integrate agriculture into national mitigation strategies. There has been some progress in setting mitigation targets for agriculture but the global level of ambition for the sector falls well short of what is required for it to contribute to limiting the global temperature increases to below 2<sup>o</sup>C.</p> <p>At present, only two countries have introduced legally binding targets for agricultural emission reductions, and a handful of others have included mitigation targets for agriculture in their Nationally Determined Contributions under the Paris Climate Agreement. Clearly, there is a need to step up the global level of policy ambition to be in line with the agriculture sector’s potential to mitigate climate change. </p>	VIDEO:	Pushing our City Limits, OECD (2018)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nz5DlTnJlDM&feature=emb_logo	REPORT:	Rethinking Urban Sprawl, OECD (2018)	https://www.oecd.org/publications/rethinking-urban-sprawl-9789264189881-en.htm	REPORT:	Enhancing Climate Change Mitigation through Agriculture, OECD (2019)	https://dx.doi.org/10.1787/88b5c98c-en
Agriculture	5	1-5	05	Inform consumers and producers about food choices and how to reduce food waste	<p>Policies should aim to reduce food waste along supply chains, from farms and farmers through transport and retail practices, to consumers. Cutting food waste and loss could help cut emissions, although policy must deal with trade-offs, such as lost income to farmers. Where access to sufficient protein is not an issue, policies to promote lower-emission food choices may also help, such as encouraging more plant-based food choices or shifting to sourcing from lower-emission livestock systems. </p> <p>Educational measures, such as information campaigns for producers, are important,  along with adequate infrastructure, such as storage facilities, and legal frameworks, for instance to facilitate collaboration between local entities and charities. Information campaigns can also help consumers cut waste by encouraging them to choose, store and prepare food properly. </p>	REPORT:	Enhancing Climate Change Mitigation through Agriculture, OECD (2019)	https://dx.doi.org/10.1787/88b5c98c-en	REPORT:	Tackling Environmental Problems with the Help of Behavioural Insights, OECD (2017)	https://www.oecd.org/env/tackling-environmental-problems-with-the-help-of-behavioural-insights-9789264273887-en.htm	REPORT:	Food waste along the food chain, OECD (2014)	https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/agriculture-and-food/food-waste-along-the-food-chain_5jxrcmftzj36-en
Building	1	2-1	06	Ensure public procurement is climate-friendly and invest in sustainable buildings 	<p>Governments can show the way by investing in green public procurement, requiring contractors to uphold sustainable practices and material use for large infrastructure projects such as schools, bridges and social housing. This not only addresses climate change but also encourages contractors, architects and planners to innovate with new low-carbon materials, methodologies and designs. </p> <p>The Navarra Social Housing project in Spain, for example, aims to build 524 energy efficient social homes for rent, in line with their sustainable construction standard, between 2018 and 2021. These flats will achieve savings of up to 90% with nearly zero emissions, and create almost 300 jobs. </p> <p>Setting rules and standards is key, as is the case in the Netherlands where only sustainable cement is allowed in building projects. To maximise innovation and sustainability in public procurement, the Netherlands uses the MEAT methodology - Most Economically Advantageous Tender - which rewards tenders that include reductions in emissions and a lower overall environmental impact. </p> 	VIDEO:	Financing Climate Futures - Rethinking Infrastructure, OECD (2018)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzDNEx3l_eY&feature=emb_logo	REPORT:	Financing Climate Futures - Rethinking Infrastructure, OECD (2018)	https://dx.doi.org/10.1787/9789264308114-en	REPORT:	Transition to sustainable buildings, International Energy Agency (2013)	https://www.oecd.org/publications/transition-to-sustainable-buildings-9789264202955-en.htm
Building	2	2-2	07	Put in place stringent climate-friendly building codes and standards	<p>Rapid urbanisation and a rising population will require more and more new homes and offices. For new buildings, sustainable certification schemes and standards can decrease emissions, and at reasonable cost. Such schemes cover sustainable building materials, integrated sustainable waste and water management systems and accessibility to amenities. </p> <p>Mandatory emissions limits could be considered, such as those used in New York City, which cap emissions per square metre based on a building’s size, function and shape. Net-zero and near-zero energy building standards are increasingly used to set high-energy performance requirements so that buildings consume the same or close to the same amount of energy as they produce, mostly from on-site or nearby renewable energy sources. The European Union for example requires all new buildings to be compliant with near-zero building standards by 2021. </p> <p>Low-energy houses are becoming more affordable and cost-effective compared with conventional buildings, and policy should compel contractors and building firms to produce them whenever possible. For instance, the so-called Passive House standard is a powerful voluntary certification for buildings, and increasingly used worldwide. Thanks to sound construction features, Passive House buildings are highly energy efficient, affordable and comfortable to live in, allowing for substantial energy savings of, up to 90% compared to regular existing buildings, and 75% compared to regular new buildings. </p>	REPORT:	Financing Climate Futures - Rethinking Infrastructure, OECD (2018)	https://dx.doi.org/10.1787/9789264308114-en	REPORT:	Transition to sustainable buildings, International Energy Agency (2013)	https://www.oecd.org/publications/transition-to-sustainable-buildings-9789264202955-en.htm			
Building	3	2-3	08	Use tax and financial incentives to renovate existing buildings 	<p>Improving the energy efficiency of buildings in our cities, towns and villages can sharply reduce emissions. Adding low-carbon roof and wall insulation such as flax wool, upgrading appliances such as boilers, and double-glazing windows helps reduce the energy needed to heat, cool and electrify homes, factories and offices. Less energy means fewer emissions, as well as lower electricity and heating bills, enhanced comfort, and cleaner air inside homes and offices. Since buildings last for decades if not centuries, renovations made today can reduce emissions and costs over time. </p> <p>Good practice examples abound. Energiesprong is an international initiative that accelerates retrofit solutions to deliver net-zero energy homes at no additional cost for residents. In partnership with the German Energy Agency, an accelerator programme was launched in 2019 in Germany to financially support general contractors and housing providers up to EUR 180 000 to retrofit buildings. In addition, the programme offers coaching by international Energiesprong experts, workshops and pitch events. Energiesprong attracts funding through European Union funds, national sources and philanthropic contributions. </p>	VIDEO:	Financing Climate Futures - Rethinking Infrastructure, OECD (2018)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzDNEx3l_eY&feature=emb_logo	REPORT:	Financing Climate Futures - Rethinking Infrastructure, OECD (2018)	https://dx.doi.org/10.1787/9789264308114-en	REPORT:	Transition to sustainable buildings, International Energy Agency (2013)	https://www.oecd.org/publications/transition-to-sustainable-buildings-9789264202955-en.htm
Building	4	2-4	09	Mainstream sustainable building within urban and rural planning	<p>All too often, the location of a new building with respect to other services in a city is not fully considered. Since 70% of the world’s population will live in cities by 2050, the necessity of integrated infrastructure and urban planning will only grow in importance. </p> <p>Assuring public transport availability near housing, offices, shopping districts and green spaces, can enhance a city’s vibrancy and economic development, while reducing greenhouse gas emissions thanks to reduced travel. Numerous cities, including low density ones, now look at housing optimisation for different types of location. </p> <p>Encouraging compact, denser cities can be beneficial, and regulations that provide for green spaces and water areas can prevent cities from becoming too congested and overheated. Policies to ensure decent and affordable homes are also essential. In cities generally, policy makers can foster investment in green transport and online connectivity, and encourage urban farming. </p>	VIDEO:	Pushing our City Limits, OECD (2018)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nz5DlTnJlDM&feature=emb_logo	REPORT:	Rethinking Urban Sprawl, OECD (2018)	https://www.oecd.org/publications/rethinking-urban-sprawl-9789264189881-en.htm	REPORT:	Decarbonising Urban Mobility with Land Use and Transport Policies: The case of Auckland, OECD (2019)	
Building	5	2-5	10	Educate planners and contractors on how to construct and maintain green buildings	<p>Raising awareness and training personnel on green buildings is essential, not just for construction but for the likes of renewable energy installations, pollution and waste reduction systems, and assuring air quality. Many of these require rigorous qualifications and state-of-the-art techniques to ensure a transition to reliable and safe low-carbon infrastructure. </p> <p>The World Green Building Council, which started in the United Kingdom and now has offices worldwide, provides a wide range of studies, seminars and awareness raising campaigns on the importance and cost-effectiveness of green buildings. It has launched the Net Zero Carbon Buildings Commitment, which calls on cities, regions, states and companies to commit to achieving net-zero operating emissions by 2030 and net-zero buildings by 2050. To date, 35 countries use GBC expertise to green their buildings at local or national level, and 42 stakeholders have signed the Net Zero Carbon Buildings Commitment, committing to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 221 million tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub>eq, the equivalent to taking 47.3 million cars off the road each year. </p> <p>The Concrete Centre in the United Kingdom also provides guidance on how to use concrete and masonry to construct sustainable buildings that are highly energy efficient, resilient, comfortable and affordable. In support of this, they have created a package of information and tools to accompany e-learning modules on concrete materials and design. </p>	REPORT:	Tackling Environmental Problems with the Help of Behavioural Insights, OECD (2017)	https://www.oecd.org/env/tackling-environmental-problems-with-the-help-of-behavioural-insights-9789264273887-en.htm	REPORT:	Transition to sustainable buildings, International Energy Agency (2013)	https://www.oecd.org/publications/transition-to-sustainable-buildings-9789264202955-en.htm			
Electricity 	1	3-1	11	Drive investments in green energy development, deployment and infrastructure	<p>Thanks to enormous cost reductions in recent years, electricity generation from large-scale renewables (notably wind and solar) is becoming cheaper than the generation from fossil fuels, and this trend is expected to continue. The world needs to invest around USD 1.7 trillion between 2015 and 2030 to achieve the Paris Agreement’s renewables targets. For this, investments and investment incentives in green energy infrastructure must be expanded to mobilise private investment in low-emission and climate-resilient infrastructure. Investment and pension funds are showing new interest, which should be encouraged through improved environmental risk analysis, clear frameworks for diversified financial instruments and models, and expediting building permits for clean electricity infrastructure. </p> <p>Support mechanisms should be applied to provide investment incentives while reducing investment risks in renewable energy projects. Competitive auctions are more cost-effective than administratively set tariffs. Moreover, support mechanisms can be broadened to include job creation and local economic development. For example, South Africa’s Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Program (REIPPPP) assigns 70% of the auction score on the bid price, and the remaining 30% is allocated based on socio-economic dimensions including job creation, black ownership and enterprise development. Between 2011 and 2015, the REIPPPP is estimated to have created more than 100 000 direct full-time jobs. </p>	ARTICLE:	Investing in Renewable Energy, OECD Observer (2017)	https://www.oecdobserver.org/news/fullstory.php/aid/5980/Investment_in_renewable_energy:_What_policymakers_must_do_to_make_it_happen.html	REPORT:	For sustainable development and nuclear energy	https://www.oecd-nea.org/sd/	REPORT:	IEA 2018 Renewables Report, International Energy Agency (2018)	https://www.iea.org/reports/renewables-2018
Electricity 	2	3-2	12	Phase out coal and tap the potential of new sources of energy generation	<p>Phasing out coal is challenging. For it to happen, the broad economic, social and political impacts on regions and communities must form part of the strategy. In Germany, for example, the Commission on Growth, Structural Change and Employment is working to achieve a smooth coal phase-out by 2038, by advising on how to support structural change, retraining, providing early retirement options, and more. </p> <p>Distributed energy resources, including rooftop solar, distributed storage, and electric vehicles, are transforming the current electricity system and offer vast potential for addressing the intermittency of renewable generation.  So-called “behind the meter” generation  produces power on site and turns customers into “prosumers”, as they can sell excess energy back to the grid. Uptake of distributed generation can be increased through net-metering schemes, financial incentives and mandatory deployment of distributed generation for new buildings. Policy should encourage the deployment of smart meters to enable real-time pricing and emerging business models to optimise demand and help integrate variable renewable energy such as wind and solar. </p>	ARTICLE:	Phase Them Out!

Electricity 	3	3-3	13	Price carbon and address barriers holding up the transition to sustainable energy	<p>Pricing carbon emissions and phasing out fossil fuel subsidies are vital to lower the amount of carbon used in electricity generation. Switching from coal to renewables (and to a lesser extent to natural gas) will not only reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but deliver other positive effects, from reducing air pollution to creating jobs in renewable energy and related sectors. </p> <p>Carbon pricing will speed up the deployment of clean and renewable energy and drive investments towards zero-carbon technologies, while generating government revenue. In 2012-16, a United Kingdom carbon tax scheme called the Carbon Price Support (CPS) led to a 78% reduction of coal use in electricity generation and a 58% decrease in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, with marked improvements in air quality and continued affordability. </p> <p>Targeted income transfers or dedicated energy-efficiency programmes can also help affordability. For example, in 2016, France switched from social energy tariffs to energy cheques to help households pay their energy bills. Depending on income and building characteristics, 5.8 million eligible households received a cheque of up to EUR 277 in 2019 to go towards utility and electricity bills. </p>	VIDEO:	Carbon Pricing Trends, OECD (2018)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdqwVaEBgmw	REPORT:	Taxing Energy Use 2019: Using Taxes for Climate Action, OECD (2019)	https://dx.doi.org/10.1787/058ca239-en	REPORT:	Effective Carbon Rates 2018 & Inventory of Fossil Fuels, OECD (2018)	https://www.oecd.org/tax/effective-carbon-rates-2018-9789264305304-en.htm
Electricity 	4	3-4	14	Channel public money into green electricity, leveraging the weight of sub-national governments	<p>Multilateral and national development banks have broad leverage in shaping electricity infrastructure and must play a key role in facilitating investments. More lending money for renewable projects will accelerate the transition towards a sustainable electricity sector. In 2019, the European Investment Bank, the world's largest international public lending institution, announced an end to fossil fuel energy project financing beginning in 2022. Similarly, Norway’s Government Pension Fund no longer invests in companies whose business models are focused on fossil fuels. </p> <p>Sub-national and city governments can also lead the way towards a low-carbon economy, with more ambitious targets on greenhouse gas emissions reductions and higher shares of renewable energy. Copenhagen and Oslo for instance aim to become carbon neutral by 2025. Cities can leverage the low-carbon transition as owners and operators of energy infrastructure and public buildings, through direct investment in biomass plants, encouraging rooftop solar panels, and taking visible action to improve the energy efficiency of public buildings, for example though energy performance contracts and public-private partnerships. </p>	ARTICLE:	New Energy in the Electricity Sector, OECD Observer (2017)	https://www.oecdobserver.org/news/fullstory.php/aid/5862/New_energy_in_the_electricity_sector.html	ARTICLE:	Carbon Prices are Still Far Too Low to Prevent Climate Change, OECD Observer (2017)	https://oecdinsights.org/2017/11/13/carbon-prices-are-still-far-too-low-to-prevent-climate-change/	REPORT:	Carbon Pricing and Competitiveness: Are They at Odds?

Electricity 	5	3-5	15	Empower investors and consumers with information on sustainable electricity	<p>Policy makers should provide investors with information on the environmental sustainability of their investments, using taxonomies for instance. The European Commission has included a proposed voluntary-based taxonomy in its 2018 Action Plan on Financing Sustainable Growth.  Once implemented, this proposal could provide more visibility to decarbonised electricity generation in financial-market portfolios. This, in turn, can influence corporate and investor decision making, and support the achievement of the Paris Agreement goals. </p> <p>While minimum energy performance standards are the most effective means to improving energy efficiency, broad and frequent feedback to consumers on energy usage can also reduce consumption, and spur investment in energy efficient practices and products, as well as the adoption of renewable energy sources. These can include more salient energy efficiency framing, such as clear and visual energy efficiency labels, green defaults and communications campaigning for renewable energy uptake, as well as direct feedback to consumers, such as clearer energy bills. Real-time information on the carbon content of electricity consumption can steer consumers towards less carbon intense hours.  </p>	ARTICLE:	Cool Generation, OECD Observer (2018)	https://www.oecdobserver.org/news/fullstory.php/aid/6135/Cool_generation.html	ARTICLE:	Tackling Environmental Problems with the Help of Behavioural Insights, OECD (2017)	https://www.oecd.org/env/tackling-environmental-problems-with-the-help-of-behavioural-insights-9789264273887-en.htm			
Industry	1	4-1	16	Scale-up research and development to create new low-carbon industrial processes	<p>The high temperatures needed for transforming raw materials into primary materials cannot be easily electrified and current alternatives are all expensive or technically difficult. Entirely new processes will need to be created to decarbonise heavy industry. The challenge for the industry is to scale up promising technologies so they can be widely used and commercially viable. Discovering these new low-carbon processes will take time, but governments can help by investing in R&D to catalyse innovation. </p> <p>Sweden is leading the way with two promising projects in cement and steel - the highest emitting sub-sectors in industry. The Swedish CemZero project is a pilot study on electrified cement production (which would be close to zero emissions if the electricity is fossil fuel free), and aims for zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2030. This would equal a 5% reduction of Sweden’s total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Likewise, the Swedish HYBRIT aims to create zero carbon steel across the supply chain - from the mining of iron ore to the fabrication of steel - using hydrogen technologies. </p> <p>The European Union is also investing heavily to push the innovation frontier. One of the missions for the Horizon 2020 funding is to strengthen the European value chain for low-carbon hydrogen and fuel cells for energy- and carbon-intensive industry, in particular the steel industry and the chemicals sector. </p>	ARTICLE:	Bioeconomy 101: Making Rubber Tyres From Dandelions, OECD Observer (2018)	https://www.oecdobserver.org/news/fullstory.php/aid/6035/Bioeconomy_101:_Making_rubber_tyres_from_dandelions.html	ARTICLE:	Mining and Green Growth in the EECCA Region OECD (2019)	https://dx.doi.org/10.1787/1926a45a-en	REPORT:	Regions in Industrial Transition: Policies for People and Places, OECD (2019)	https://dx.doi.org/10.1787/c76ec2a1-en
Industry	2	4-2	17	Regulate energy efficiency in plants to lower emissions  	<p>Heavy industry is highly energy-intensive. Transforming raw materials from the earth into primary materials - like steel, cement, aluminium, glass -requires very high temperatures. More effort is needed to find ways of reaching these temperatures without relying on fossil fuels like coal, but a good short-term alternative is to improve the energy efficiency of plants with strong or mandatory goals. </p> <p>Since 2009, Japan sets mandatory performance benchmarks for energy use from heavy industry plants to improve energy efficiency by 1% per year since 2009.  Russia has several laws in place which set federal and regional energy efficiency standards for industrial consumers, such as steel, aluminium, paper. These firms are required to submit energy efficiency and thermal efficiency performance certificates annually. Any plants that cannot meet these benchmarks are phased out. </p> <p>Alongside standards, the use of Energy Management Systems can also improve the overall efficiency of plants, thereby lowering energy consumption. Projections show that implementing <a href="https://www.iso.org/iso-50001-energy-management.html" target="_blank">ISO 50001</a>, a standard to encourage continual improvement, can lead to deep reductions in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. </p>	REPORT:	Extended Producer Responsibility: Updated Guidance for Efficient Waste Management, OECD (2016) 	https://dx.doi.org/10.1787/9789264256385-en	REPORT:	The Macroeconomics of the Circular Economy Transition: A Critical Review of Modelling Approaches, OECD (2018) 	https://dx.doi.org/10.1787/af983f9a-en			
Industry	3	4-3	18	Price carbon while maintaining competitiveness to lower emissions and spur innovation	<p>The extraction and processing of materials and chemicals used in heavy industry - steel, cement, aluminium, glass, pulp and paper, and petrochemicals - generate high emissions that must be addressed. Carbon prices are often kept very low in order to maintain competitiveness, but carbon prices must rise, which means putting in place effective emissions trading schemes or carbon taxes amongst others. </p> <p>There are a number of ways to implement carbon pricing, so that it does not hurt firms’ competitiveness and, in turn, catalyses innovation. These include: setting a carbon price floor (preventing the carbon price from going too low to guarantee certain returns), international co-operation on carbon pricing for all countries or even co-operating globally to set a carbon price within a given industry - such as creating a carbon price for all cement firms globally. </p>	REPORT:	Carbon Pricing and Competitiveness: Are They at Odds?

Industry	4	4-4	19	Lead the way for other economic sectors in shifting from linear to circular resource efficiency	<p>Our economies need to shift from being linear to circular. A linear economy is one that extracts resources, produces products, consumes them, and then disposes of them, creating a system of emissions and resource use. A circular economy creates a system that aims to keep products, components and materials in the economy for as long as possible, trying to eliminate waste and virgin resource inputs. This kind of system change requires using recycled secondary materials instead of virgin raw materials, designing products to be robust and repairable so they last longer, and using materials more efficiently, for example, through increased material productivity. </p><p>There are different tools for countries to incentivise this change - such as facilitating the trade of scrap materials, removing import bans - in addition to Extended Producer Responsibility requirements - holding producers responsible for products at the end of life, product take-back requirements, and advanced disposal fees. Product take-back requirements typically set recycling or collection targets for a given product or material, e.g., the European Union’s Waste Directive for Electronic Waste. Likewise, advance disposal fees (ADFs) are charged at the time of purchase, ideally, to cover the costs of collection and treatment of the product. When the ADF is transparent to the consumer, it may influence both consumer and manufacturer behaviour. </p>	INITIATIVE:	Re-circle - resource efficiency and circular economy (2019) 	https://www.oecd.org/environment/waste/recircle.htm	REPORT:	Extended Producer Responsibility: Updated Guidance for Efficient Waste Management, OECD (2016) 	https://dx.doi.org/10.1787/9789264256385-en	REPORT:	Policy Guidance on Resource Efficiency, OECD (2016)	https://dx.doi.org/10.1787/9789264257344-en
Industry	5	4-5	20	Educate for energy and resource efficient sustainable industrial practices 	<p>Educating actors across supply chains is fundamental for the transition to energy and resource efficiency. It helps unearth solutions, such as using waste from one industry as input in another. The United Kingdom’s Internal Synergies programme promotes such industrial symbiosis. Between 2005 and 2013, the United Kingdom’s National Industrial Symbiosis Programme was rolled out across all nine English regions and reduced CO<sub>2</sub> by 42 million tonnes, diverted 47 million tonnes of industrial waste from landfill, created over 10 000 jobs, and saved 60 million tonnes of virgin material, including 73 million tonnes of industrial water. The United Kingdom is now spreading its expertise, reaching 30 countries so far. </p><p>The European Union runs a European Resource Efficiency Knowledge Centre that offers a free self-assessment tool for small- and medium-sized firms working in 12 industries. SMEs answer questions on their consumption of energy, materials, water and waste, and the platform creates a personalised report with a set of actions for firms to be more efficient in these areas. </p><p>Other countries provide a consultancy. For example, France has a programme called Winning on All Counts led by an environmental and energy agency, the <a href="https://www.ademe.fr/" target=“_blank">ADEME</a>, for SMEs in industry to improve their resource efficiency, particularly targeting those with high energy and material consumption, with limited time and knowledge to undertake efficiency improvements.

Transport 	1	5-1	21	Scale-up research, production and use of zero-emission fuels	<p>Alternative fuels are the key to emissions-free transport, with electric mobility being the most advanced. In Norway, 46% of all new cars sold in 2018 were electric. Worldwide, 5.1 million electric cars were sold in 2018, up from 3.1 million in 2017. Still, they only make up about 0.5% of the global vehicle stock. Future uptake depends fundamentally on progress with battery technology to increase range, availability of charging infrastructure to reassure users, and ultimately on the price. The extent to which governments invest, and the range of incentives they put in place, will matter. </p> <p>It is unlikely that one single new energy source can replace oil for energy intensity. Government policy should act according to different technologies and uses. Electric mobility should be boosted to decarbonise urban traffic, for instance, which would slash emissions and improve air quality. Also, if flights under 1 000 kilometres used electric aircraft, this could save 15% of jet fuel. Hydrogen has advantages for longer ranges and where fast refuelling is necessary, for trucks or maritime transport for instance. Ships are also rediscovering wind power.  The use of biofuels and synthetic fuels should be stepped up as they allow conventional engines to run virtually carbon free, if sustainably produced. To boost this sector, Sweden now requires conventional fuels to be blended with biofuels to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of diesel by 21% and of petrol by 4.2% by 2020. </p>	VIDEO:	10 Facts about Transport and Climate Change, International Transport Forum (2019)	https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCndtbdzClUoBVCBvteFwQaQ	REPORT:	ITF Transport Outlook 2019, International Transport Forum (2019)	https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/transport/itf-transport-outlook-2019_transp_outlook-en-2019-en	POLICY BRIEF :	Is Low-Carbon Road Freight Possible? International Transport Forum (2018)	https://www.itf-oecd.org/low-carbon-road-freight
Transport 	2	5-2	22	Create conditions that increase accessibility and maximise use of transport capacity	<p>The average private car is used for just 50 minutes a day and carries 1.4 passengers. Studies show that car sharing can provide the same flexibility as private cars, but with just 10% fewer vehicles. That would reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from cars by one third without introducing new technology. Because shared vehicles clock more miles, they are replaced more quickly and new low-carbon technologies hit the road faster. Public parking becomes redundant and the space can be used in more eco-friendly ways - for walking and cycling, or less polluting delivery of goods. Importantly, shared mobility services can act as feeders for public transport. The largest CO<sub>2</sub> reductions in the transport sector would come from shared electric vehicles.  </p><p>Moving goods is an ever more important part of transport. The share of freight will grow to nearly 50% of all transport activity by 2050, from just over a third today. Keeping down the associated CO<sub>2</sub> emissions will require better use of trucks and ships. Smart logistics solutions can help maximise capacity use - more efficient use of data, for instance, or sharing depots and delivery vans. Also, larger trucks or ships can move more freight with comparatively less energy. Still, care is needed to improve CO<sub>2</sub> efficiency along the entire supply chain. </p> <p>Governments should also strive to bring the costs of rail down to make it more competitive, modern and attractive for passengers, particularly on shorter national and transcontinental journeys, in Europe for instance. More investment should be channelled into new railways in developing countries and remote regions. </p>	VIDEO:	How Shared Self-driving Cars Could Change City Traffic, International Transport Forum (2015)  	https://youtu.be/j9kK0RHl-LI	INITIATIVE:	How Shared Mobility Can Make Cities More Liveable, International Transport Forum (2018)	https://www.itf-oecd.org/itf-work-shared-mobility	REPORT:	High Capacity Transport: Towards Efficient, Safe an Sustainable Road Freight, International Transport Forum (2019)	https://www.itf-oecd.org/high-capacity-transport
Transport 	3	5-3	23	Set prices to encourage sustainable passenger mobility and freight transport	<p>Transport relies on fossil fuels for over 94% of its energy. Zero- and low-carbon transport solutions will scale up only if they can compete on price. Road fuels are taxed relatively heavily - but not nearly to an extent that covers the cost of environmental harm. Preferential rates exist, too, for example for fuels used by trucks. Meanwhile international aviation and maritime fuels are not taxed at all.  </p> <p>Price signals are a powerful mechanism to steer citizens and businesses to choose less emitting forms of transport. Carbon prices can be set with different tools, notably direct taxes or emissions trading schemes. Purchase taxes on polluting vehicles and targeted subsidies can also help citizens and businesses buy into sustainable transport. Emissions and congestion charges on vehicles in cities have proved effective. Some have reduced local CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by around 15%. But road pricing should be fair and equitable. Revenues should be used in a transparent way and contribute to measures that effectively reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions Stockholm, for instance, introduced a congestion charge and invested the proceeds to expand its metro network. </p>	VIDEO:	10 Facts about Transport and Climate Change, International Transport Forum (2019)	https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCndtbdzClUoBVCBvteFwQaQ	ARTICLE:	The Long Flight Towards Clean Aviation, OECD Observer (2017)	https://www.oecdobserver.org/news/fullstory.php/aid/6016/The_long_flight_towards_clean_aviation.html	POLICY BRIEF :	How to Make Urban Mobility Clean and Green, International Transport Forum (2018)	https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.itf-oecd.org%2Furban-mobility-clean-green&data=02%7C01%7CFlora.MONSAINGEON-LAVURI%40oecd.org%7C0d7ab620dc5c4fcbb62a08d774e1b44a%7Cac41c7d41f61460db0f4fc925a2b471c%7C0%7C0%7C637106385052861983&sdata=r%2FDexP%2FdmM1GfqGVtTtQE19EKeaVulqGYHmTKCi9Q%2Bw%3D&reserved=0
Transport 	4	5-4	24	Make low-carbon transport the default for public sector decision making	<p>Governments should champion low- and zero-carbon transport and set an example for citizens and businesses. Investing in public transport, promoting walking and cycling, and providing good charging infrastructure are examples where public policy can make low-carbon transport the default and environmental sustainability the benchmark. Integrating transport planning with land-use policy and promoting urban densification will bring jobs, goods and services closer to people and  reduce the need for commuting. </p> <p>Public procurement provides another lever. Awarding contracts should take into account the carbon footprint of the bids. For instance, in Sweden, the tender for a ferry between Stockholm and the island of Gotland included greenhouse gas emissions as a criterion. The winning bid uses Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG), resulting in 20% lower CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. </p> <p>Governments operate large vehicle fleets. They should make the purchase of low- or zero-emission vehicles their default policy, which would send a strong political signal, not least to businesses that also have large fleets. </p>	VIDEO:	10 Facts about Transport and Climate Change, International Transport Forum (2019)	https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCndtbdzClUoBVCBvteFwQaQ	INITIATIVE:	The Global Policy Dialogue of the ITF Decarbonising Transport Initiative (2016)	https://www.itf-oecd.org/DT	POLICY BRIEF :	How to Better Reflect Transport in Climate Action Efforts, International Transport Forum (2018)	https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.itf-oecd.org%2Fclimate-action-efforts&data=02%7C01%7CFlora.MONSAINGEON-LAVURI%40oecd.org%7C0d7ab620dc5c4fcbb62a08d774e1b44a%7Cac41c7d41f61460db0f4fc925a2b471c%7C0%7C0%7C637106385052871977&sdata=zHr0l3j1ROY2tB5741bJ%2FNPJVpdQFag0%2FP1FCvwAGmU%3D&reserved=0
Transport 	5	5-5	25	Share knowledge about tested measures that reduce transport emissions	<p>A single invention to stop global heating is unlikely to be found. Doing what is already possible, on all fronts, by everyone, will be the most effective policy approach. More public-private co-operation nationally and internationally is necessary to create the conditions for the introduction and scaling up of decarbonisation measures as rapidly as possible. </p> <p>Effective interventions should be further deployed. These include operational measures like the “slow steaming” of freight ships, which reduces greenhouse gas emissions by 19% for a 10% reduction in speed, but can yield reduction up to 60%. Educational measures also work, for instance “eco-driving” training for truck drivers - fuel-efficient driving styles reduce trucks carbon emissions by up to 15%. Design improvements like air lubrication of ship hulls or weight optimisation in aircraft also save CO<sub>2</sub>. Streamlined customs procedures cut carbon, as trucks no longer have to inch forward for hours or even days at border points while emitting diesel fumes. Governments and businesses should intensify their collaboration to create pilot projects and test decarbonisation opportunities. </p>	VIDEO:	10 Facts about Transport and Climate Change, International Transport Forum (2019)	https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCndtbdzClUoBVCBvteFwQaQ	ARTICLE:	Adapting Transport to Climate Change and Extreme Weather, OECD Observer (2017)	https://www.oecdobserver.org/news/fullstory.php/aid/6159/An_uncertain_climate.html	REPORT:	Tackling Environmental Problems with the Help of Behavioural Insights, OECD (2017)	https://www.oecd.org/env/tackling-environmental-problems-with-the-help-of-behavioural-insights-9789264273887-en.ht
